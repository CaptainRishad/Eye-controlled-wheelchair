A low-cost eye-blink controlled wheelchair using Arduino and Bluetooth for assistive mobility.


 🦽 Eye-Controlled Wheelchair

A **low-cost eye-blink controlled wheelchair** using Arduino and Bluetooth, designed to help people with severe mobility impairments move independently using simple eye gestures.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses **IR-based eye blink sensors** mounted on glasses to detect eye movements.
The detected blink patterns are processed by an **Arduino Nano**, which sends control commands wirelessly via **Bluetooth (HC-05)** to an **Arduino Uno** that controls the wheelchair motors using relays.

The system is designed to be:

* Affordable
* Easy to build
* Reliable for assistive mobility applications

---

## ✨ Features

* Eye-blink based directional control
* Wireless Bluetooth communication
* Dual Arduino architecture (Master–Slave)
* Simple relay-based motor control
* Low-cost assistive technology solution

---

## 🧠 Working Principle

1. IR eye blink sensors detect eye closure and movement.
2. Arduino Nano processes the blink patterns.
3. Control commands are sent via HC-05 Bluetooth (Master).
4. Arduino Uno receives commands (Slave).
5. Relays switch the wheelchair motors accordingly.
